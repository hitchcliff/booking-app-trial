# How to run

1. Create DATABASE and name it `booking-test`
2. cd to `./server` then run `yarn dev` make sure to run `yarn install` first to install deps
3. cd to `./web` then run `yarn dev` make sure to run `yarn install` first to install the deps

P.S. If you encounter database errors which usually happen when `postgres` is not installed.
you can use the postgres database in vscode :)
